👨‍💻 About Me

Identity-focused IT professional specializing in hybrid infrastructure, access governance, and endpoint security. I support and secure environments serving ~1,300 users across Microsoft 365 and Active Directory/Entra ecosystems.

My work centers on:

Identity lifecycle management

RBAC and conditional access enforcement

Endpoint hardening and administration

Workflow automation using Aquera and PowerShell

AWS WorkSpaces administration with secure remote access controls

I use automation and structured access design to reduce manual errors, improve compliance posture, and increase operational efficiency.

This GitHub documents my certification journey and will increasingly host hands-on cloud and security projects as I deepen my AWS and IAM expertise.
